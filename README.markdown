# Sequel-X
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garrettheaver/sequel-x.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garrettheaver/sequel-x)

Extending Ruby 'sequel' gem behaviours, usually for use with PostgreSQL.

## Warning
This project has pretty much been abandoned and has not seen active development for some time. It may however still be of some use and I have brought it up to date with Ruby 2.3 (specs pass) but it is not being actively maintained or used by me.

## Plugins
 - x_class_table - Custom class table inheritance plugin
 - x_pg_json_attr - Define model attributes that map to a key on a json column
